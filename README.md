# CSum
One of my first GUI program in C++.

It can be used to check the Checksum of any file regardless of its extension. It works ultra-fast and is suitable for extremely large files. It works with 3 algorithms. It also includes a bunch of super small tools, such as calculating AES Symmetric Encryption with 3 different cipher methods.

I have also made a CIL version of this program in C. Which is more flexible and lightweight than the UI version.
