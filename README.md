# CSum
One of my first GUI program in C++.

It can be used to check the Checksum of any file regardless of its extension, works ultra-fast, and is suitable for extremely large-size files. Works with 3 algorithms.
Also, includes a bunch of super small tools. Like to calculate AES Symmetric Encryption with 3 different cipher methods.
